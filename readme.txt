Project 2B - SWEN20003 Object-oriented Programming
Student ID: 941113

This project has replaced some images with fancier ones:
1. The green frog: becomes Mattie the Froggo.
2. The blue extra life: becomes Ellie the Saviour
3. The life-remaining tile: becomes fancy Iron Man Arc Reactor, because Matt loves Iron Man (and I do too).

I have also made an assumption:
--> When moving to the next level, the remaining lives of the player is always 3.
This ignores every lives the player has gained (or lost) in the previous level(s).

Cheers.
